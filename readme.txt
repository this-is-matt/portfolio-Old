3/14/2022 worked for 2 hours -  built file structure, researched mvc, built most of nav. still need to build controller function.

3/17/2022 Worked for 3 hours - Reworked the MVC structure a bit, finished the dynamic navigation. Couldn't figure out how to iterate through the object returned by my fetch, adjusted the structure of that a bit to make it more usable. was using a forEach to build the nav elements, but because my json file contains two arrays, one with link value and the other with the path, i determined a single for-in loop would be a better choice. I feel like i struggled more than i should have on this. But i am thrilled i got through it with a working product. Hopefully i can have more forethought throughout the rest of the project. 

3/22/2022 Worked for 2 hours - Trouble making the sliding nav

3/23/2022 Worked for 4 hours - Fixed sliding curatin nav - developed landing page. It feels pretty old looking, will try to spice it up at the end if i can find the time. right now, i have the MVP so i will move on and come back  it.  next up currency API.

04/4/2022 worked for 2 hours - Research Currency Exchange AI, build MVC file structure. 

4/5/2022 worked for 4 hours - built out conversion pair api, created all the exchange rate pages, wrote out documentation for that. spent some time planning what to adjust for nail lady britt. Had some issues getting nodes from DOM because i forgot to defer my script tags. fixed the navpaths in the view js file. Think that needs to be moved to the controller or a helper function file. Not sure. Also added connections to the other projects on my portfolio page. I think i am going to adjust the styling of the portfolio to be brighter. Having a hard time making it look classy with the dark mode styling. I don't think i will be able to finish everything i set out to for this project, but i will do my best. Just realized i need to make the portfolio responsive. I also want to take a few minutes next work session to look through the material for the class this semester to see if i missed anything that i need to demonstrate. I haven't used JS class objects yet, don't really see a need but i will try to work at least one in.  

04/06/2022 worked for 5 hours - started working on the other currency exchange app. Was able to grab data. However, it's not incredibly clean. I decided that i would be better off spending time perfecting the Conversion end-point based application. So i went back to that one. There i changed the inputs to selects, created a json file with all the currencyu exchange code/country data. created workflow to obtain said data. Now the selects are dynamically poluated by that json file. Decided i really needed to redo the look of the Portfolio landing page. Made some progress there. Needs much more work however.
