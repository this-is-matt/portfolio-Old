            <h2>Learning Process</h2>
            <p>This is not the first time I have connected to a simple API such as this one. One this that I thought was
                interesting was how i used a string literal for the URL that i provided to the Fetch statement. This
                allowed me to very easily provide default values for the amount, and easily have a dynamic URL based on
                the user input. The somewhat dangerous part is that i am not currently validating the users input, which
                is not good practice. I don't know what type of server side validation the exchange rate API has. I am
                sure it is up to par, but it would be best if i had my own Client side validation and sanitation in
                place for both the currency codes and the dollar amount.
            </p>
            <p>I struggled with getting the nodes from the DOM because i had my script tags in the header and i
                neglected to defer them. So it was applying the query selectors to null values. It took me WAY too long
                to figure that out. I need to figure out a way to remember simple things like that. I think that mostly
                just comes with practice i guess.
            </p>
            <p>Took me a minute to remember that the best way to get data our of a fetch is to call a function inside
                the .then. It is by far easier than anything else i tried. It may actually be the only way to properly
                do it? I am not sure.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Updates to Project</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some error handling on fetch statements for both the conversion and standard requests</li>
                <li>Client Side validation and sanitation for the inputs. Could easily add a regex pattern to assist
                    with this.</li>
                <li>For the conversion app i could return the converted result, but i could also return the return rate.
                    Don't currently return that, but there is no reason not to.</li>
                <li>For the conversion app i could return the Last updated time and the time it will next be updated.
                    API Returns it, i just haven't added it.</li>
                <li>Would love to get rid of awful currency code table and replace the input values with a json
                    populated dropdown. That way i would be able to update my lists super easily and a could make
                    dynamic lists.</li>
                <li>After i get rid of the table i need to find a way to display the information about the currency
                    codes i.e. the country and currency name in a seemless and sleek way.</li>
                <li>Site map?</li>
                <li>SEO? just for my practice, not so much because i am trying to monetize or anything.</li>
                <li>Would like to add more resources, maybe sources from other API's so that the project/site is
                    actually useful. Possibly a stock exchange integration, that might be better served in it's own
                    project. Could combine the two, get a stock value and then convert it to another currency. Could be
                    interesting.</li>
